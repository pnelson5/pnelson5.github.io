This is the first post in what I hope to be a long-running endeavor.  I have several reasons for starting this; some simple ones (I want to become a better writer!), but also some deeper motivations.  I've reflected on the past ten years of my career and realize how much I've learned, but more so how much I've forgotten.  I learned hard lessons about so many things and wish I would have just taken the time to write them down.  So better late than never.  If I can form a good habit here, I'll be thanking myself 20 years from now and probably getting a good laugh about things I thought I knew so well at the time.

And lastly, this is for my kids.  I want them to be able to read about what their Dad did for a living.  To be honest with them about how insanely frustrating this profession can be, but also why I find it so richly rewarding.
