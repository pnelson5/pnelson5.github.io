First day is in the books. I'm splitting my study time between three activities.  First, basic data structures and algorithms - I'm just using leetcode and cracking the coding interview for this. Second, I want to get back to being able to crank out basic java backends with rest apis. Last, I actually need to learn javascript.  I don't need to be an expert, but it's a little embarrassing that I've managed to make it this far in my career without knowing how to write front-end code.

A successful day overall, got in over 2 hours of practice combined before and after work.
