Worked through a few chapters of CTCI.  Amazing how much basic computer science you forget over the years.  Got a refresher on linked lists, queues, stacks and graphs. I actually had fun implementing the tree/graph stuff.  I continue to work through Leetcode and am beginning to recognize patterns in the problems.  It is insanely difficult for me right now, but I'm confident that it will become easier with time and practice.

I also worked on a side project to help knock the rust off my  backend api skills.  I'm building out a blogging application.  I'm working with jakarat ee and microprofile and I can't express just how enjoyable coding like this is.

I've got a release that I have to monitor that doesn't go out for another hour and a half, so I'll spend between then and now working on learning javascript.
