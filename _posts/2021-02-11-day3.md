I did not get up early enough to study before the kids woke up.  Work and kids kept me busy all day and it was past 9pm by the time I sat down.  The last thing I wanted to do today was study, but I managed to force myself to do an hour of leetcode.  I think writing this update is actually really helping me to maintain discipline.  I don't want to break the streak of updates and its very motivating.

I'm going to begin using weekends to work on side projects that will bolster my portfolio.  Working on actual projects is the best way to learn and I need something to apply all this material to, especially the javascript.
