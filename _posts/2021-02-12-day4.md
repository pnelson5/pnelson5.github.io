It has been a while since college.  That was the last time I dealt with bitwise operators in any meaningful way.  Today we had a refresher on a great many things I have not thought of since my time on campus.  XOR, negations, etc etc.  After that I moved onto requisite "brainteasers", do people still do these in interviews?  Better to be prepared I guess.  Capped off the study with some OO design practice and leetcode.  Another solid day, I will be ready in 3 weeks.
